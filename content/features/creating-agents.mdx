# Creating Agents

With **Web3GPT**, you can create custom AI Agents to perform specialized tasks within the platform. These agents can reason, plan, and execute actions based on your instructions.

## Steps to Create an Agent

1. **Open the Sidebar and Go to Agent Creator**

   In the Web3GPT interface, open the sidebar and click on **Agent Creator**.

2. **Provide Agent Details**

   Fill out the required fields:

   - **Name**: Give your agent a unique name.
   - **Description**: Briefly describe what your agent does.
   - **Instructions**: Provide the agent's system prompt. This defines the agent's behavior and capabilities.
   - **Creator**: Enter an identifier (ENS name, wallet address, or username).
   - **Image URL**: Optionally, provide an image URL for your agent.

3. **Follow Chat Instructions and Deploy Agent**

   The platform will guide you through the deployment process in the chat interface. Follow the prompts to finalize and deploy your agent.

4. **Access and Share Your Agent**

   After deployment, you'll receive a unique link to your agent:

   - **Test and Use the Agent**: Navigate to the provided agent link to interact with your new agent.
   - **Share with Others**: Share the link or agent ID so others can use your agent.

## Example

Let's create an agent called **Token Deployer** that helps users deploy ERC20 tokens.

- **Name**: Unstoppable Domain Resolver
- **Description**: An agent that resolves domain names to Unstoppable Domain names and ENS names.
- **Instructions**: You are a helpful assistant that can resolve domain names to Unstoppable Domain names and ENS names and vice versa.
- **Creator**: soko.eth

After deploying, share the link [https://w3gpt.ai/?a=asst_mv5KGoBLhXXQFiJHpgnopGQQ](https://w3gpt.ai/?a=asst_mv5KGoBLhXXQFiJHpgnopGQQ) with others so they can try your agent.
