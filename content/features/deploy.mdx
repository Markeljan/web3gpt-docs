# Deploy Contracts

Write smart contracts by simply describing your ideas. Our AI Agents reason, plan, then produce ready-to-compile & deploy Solidity smart contracts.

## Simple Example

Suppose you want to create an ERC20 token called "MyToken" with the symbol "MTK" and a total supply of 1,000,000 tokens. Just describe it in natural language:

```plaintext
Create an ERC20 token named MyToken with symbol MTK and total supply of 1,000,000 tokens.
```

Web3GPT will generate the Solidity code for you:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

## Deploying a Smart Contract

<Steps>
### Prompt

**Describe Your Idea:** Enter your idea, whether it's a contract, protocol, dApp idea, or utility.

### Generate

**Generate the Code:** The AI agent will plan, ask follow-up questions if needed, and produce the Solidity code for your request.

### Review

**Review the Code:** Examine the generated code and request changes in chat if necessary. Ensure there are no omitted or placeholder sections.

### Deploy

**Agent Deploy:** Deploy your contract without needing a wallet. Simply specify the target chain (e.g., "Deploy to X chain"), and the Agent will handle the deployment.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If the contract has Ownable access control, or has interactions with the
  deployer, you should provide your wallet address and request ownership of the
  contract in the chat.
</Callout>

**Manual Deployment:** Connect your wallet and click the Deploy Contract button above the source code to deploy the smart contract.

### Results

**View Deployment Results:** Navigate to the explorer link. The contract will be automatically verified within 1 minute of deployment. Visit the IPFS directory to view source code and compilation files.

### Errors

**Handle Errors:** If there are compilation errors, the agent will attempt to resolve them and show updates. For incorrect or missing parameters, the agent may retry or ask for additional information.

## Complex Example: JokeContest Contract

Let's create a more complex smart contract—a JokeContest where anyone can submit jokes, and users can vote for the funniest jokes. The top jokes appear on a leaderboard, and donations can be made to the joke submitters.

Describe your idea:

```plaintext
Create a smart contract called JokeContest where users can submit jokes. Other users can vote on the jokes. The jokes with the most votes appear on a leaderboard. Users can also donate Ether to joke submitters.
```

Example Solidity code generated by Web3GPT:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract JokeContest {
    struct Joke {
        string text;
        address submitter;
        uint256 voteCount;
    }

    Joke[] public jokes;
    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public hasVoted;

    event JokeSubmitted(uint256 jokeId, address submitter, string text);
    event JokeVoted(uint256 jokeId, address voter);
    event DonationReceived(uint256 jokeId, address donor, uint256 amount);

    function submitJoke(string memory _text) public {
        require(bytes(_text).length > 0, "Joke text cannot be empty");

        jokes.push(Joke({
            text: _text,
            submitter: msg.sender,
            voteCount: 0
        }));

        emit JokeSubmitted(jokes.length - 1, msg.sender, _text);
    }

    function voteForJoke(uint256 _jokeId) public {
        require(_jokeId < jokes.length, "Invalid joke ID");
        require(!hasVoted[_jokeId][msg.sender], "You have already voted for this joke");

        jokes[_jokeId].voteCount += 1;
        hasVoted[_jokeId][msg.sender] = true;

        emit JokeVoted(_jokeId, msg.sender);
    }

    function getLeaderboard() public view returns (Joke[] memory) {
        Joke[] memory sortedJokes = jokes;
        for(uint i = 0; i < sortedJokes.length; i++) {
            for(uint j = i + 1; j < sortedJokes.length; j++) {
                if(sortedJokes[i].voteCount < sortedJokes[j].voteCount) {
                    Joke memory temp = sortedJokes[i];
                    sortedJokes[i] = sortedJokes[j];
                    sortedJokes[j] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
        return sortedJokes;
    }

    function donateToJokeSubmitter(uint256 _jokeId) public payable {
        require(_jokeId < jokes.length, "Invalid joke ID");
        require(msg.value > 0, "Donation must be greater than zero");

        address submitter = jokes[_jokeId].submitter;
        payable(submitter).transfer(msg.value);

        emit DonationReceived(_jokeId, msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
}
```
