# TokenScript Agent

## Overview

**TokenScript Agent** empowers users to create, deploy, and manage smart contracts seamlessly by leveraging Web3GPT AI-driven code generation. Users can simply describe their requirements, and TokenScript Agent will produce the Solidity code, suggest edits, handle deployment and create a TokenScript for the deployed contract.

## Features

- **Web3GPT AI-Powered Smart Contract Generation**: Converts user descriptions into ready-to-compile Solidity contracts.
- **Automated Deployment**: Allows for contract deployment across supported EVM testnets without requiring a wallet.
- **Code Review and Customization**: Supports user interactions to fine-tune code before deployment.
- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Automatically resolves common errors and provides support for missing parameters or incorrect values.
- **Automatic Verification:** Contracts auto-verified on block explorers.
- **IPFS Integration:** Source files stored on IPFS.
- **TokenScript Creation:** Creates a TokenScript which enables users to view and interact with their deployed smart contract.

## How to Use TokenScript Agent

<Steps>

### 1. Describe Your Idea

Begin by entering a natural language description of the smart contract you wish to create. For example:

```plaintext
Create an ERC721 NFT contract with metadata stored on IPFS.
```

### 2. Generate the Code
TokenScript Agent will analyze your input and generate Solidity code accordingly. You’ll receive:

An outline of the contract (e.g., ERC721 with OpenZeppelin libraries for security).
Key features such as minting, ownership, and URI handling.
The complete Solidity code for review.

### 3. Review and Edit
Automatic Suggestions: TokenScript Agent will propose code structure, security measures, and optional libraries.
Customization: You can ask for specific changes, like adding functions or adjusting access control settings.

### 4. Deploy Your Contract
Once satisfied with the code:

Automatic Deployment: Type "Deploy to [Network Name]" to have the contract deployed on an EVM-compatible testnet.
Manual Deployment: If manual deployment is preferred, connect your wallet and use the generated code.

### 5. TokenScript Creation

TokenScript Agent will create a TokenScript for the deployed contract and provide you with the details URl which users can use to view and interact with the deployed contract.

### 6. Error Handling
TokenScript Agent attempts to fix any compilation or deployment errors automatically. For complex issues, you may need to clarify or add specific parameters.
</Steps>

## Example Walkthrough
Here’s a step-by-step example using TokenScript Agent to create and deploy an ERC721 NFT contract with metadata stored on IPFS:

<Steps> 
### 1. Describe the Contract:

```plaintext
Create an ERC721 NFT contract with metadata stored on IPFS.
```

Web3GPT will generate the Solidity code for you:

```solidity
 // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts@4.9.3/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts@4.9.3/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts@4.9.3/access/Ownable.sol";

// ERC5169 interface declaration
interface IERC5169 {
    event ScriptUpdate(string[]);

    function scriptURI() external view returns (string[] memory);
    function setScriptURI(string[] memory) external;
}

contract MyNFT is ERC721, ERC721Enumerable, Ownable, IERC5169 {
    uint private _tokenIdCounter;
    string private constant baseTokenURI = "ipfs://QmYourIPFSHashHere"; // Replace with your IPFS hash

    constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "MNFT") Ownable() {
        _tokenIdCounter = 1;
        mint();
    }

    function mint() public {
        uint tokenId = _tokenIdCounter;
        _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenId);
        _tokenIdCounter++;
    }

    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 firstTokenId, uint256 batchSize) internal override(ERC721,ERC721Enumerable) {
        // Intentionally left blank
    }

    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)
        public
        pure
        override(ERC721)
        returns (string memory)
    {
        tokenId;
        return baseTokenURI;
    }

    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
        public
        view
        override(ERC721, ERC721Enumerable)
        returns (bool)
    {
        return super.supportsInterface(interfaceId) || interfaceId == type(IERC5169).interfaceId;
    }

    string[] private _scriptURI;

    function scriptURI() external view override returns (string[] memory) {
        return _scriptURI;
    }

    function setScriptURI(string[] memory newScriptURI) external override onlyOwner {
        _scriptURI = newScriptURI;
        emit ScriptUpdate(newScriptURI);
    }
}
```
### 2. Review Your Contract

**Review Your Contract:** Examine the generated code and request changes in chat if necessary. Ensure there are no omitted or placeholder sections.

### 3. Deploy Your Contract
Once satisfied with the code:

**Automatic Deployment:**

Prompt Web3GPT agent with:

```plaintext
Deploy to Sepolia
```
And you will get this response from Our AI agent:


The ERC721 NFT contract has been successfully deployed on the Sepolia network!

- Contract Address: [0x1D449aA762E5F0E6E35E0663226445b9ce11942a](https://eth-sepolia.blockscout.com/address/0xB3E003ed3D8870A9e8861f07C682293Eee05Acd5)
- IPFS Repository: [Source Code on IPFS](https://web3gpt.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeibatghmh6ozw4hfhcsdvpgolytfocdvjwwbmz6imqp7zilhsmyoyi)

If you'd like to proceed with creating a TokenScript or need any further assistance, please let me know!

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If the contract has Ownable access control, or has interactions with the
  deployer, you should provide your wallet address and request ownership of the
  contract in the chat.
</Callout>

**Manual Deployment:** Connect your wallet and click the Deploy Contract button above the source code to deploy the smart contract.

### Results

**View Deployment Results:** Navigate to the explorer link. The contract will be automatically verified within 1 minute of deployment. Visit the IPFS directory to view source code and compilation files.

### 4. TokenScript Creation

Prompt Web3GPT agent with:

```plaintext
Create a TokenScript for this contract
```
And you will get this response from Our AI agent:

The TokenScript for the deployed NFT contract has been successfully created and uploaded. Here are the details:

- Transaction Explorer URL: [View Transaction](https://eth-sepolia.blockscout.com/tx/0x8bf8c2de4eb2ce0876d6ae1b881fbe34ea7c126d61acaf70246ab5464967eea9)
- IPFS URL for TokenScript: [IPFS Link](https://web3gpt.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreifoexndqzgtgozavckmuiutjy7a4w4axu3bgnkh6qjm4hrg2hamne)
- Viewer URL: [TokenScript Viewer](https://viewer.tokenscript.org/?chain=11155111&contract=0xb3e003ed3d8870a9e8861f07c682293eee05acd5)

You can use the viewer URL to explore how your TokenScript looks and interacts with the smart contract. If there's anything more you'd like to do, please let me know!

### Errors

**Handle Errors:** If there are compilation errors, the agent will attempt to resolve them and show updates. For incorrect or missing parameters, the agent may retry or ask for additional information.
