# Creator Agent

The **Creator Agent** is a versatile AI-powered assistant for interacting with blockchain addresses, domain names, and smart contract deployment. This document outlines the capabilities of the Creator Agent, as well as how to effectively interact with it to accomplish specific blockchain tasks.

## Agent Capabilities

The Creator Agent can perform the following tasks:

- **resolveAddress**: Converts a blockchain address into a human-readable domain name, if such a record exists.
- **resolveDomain**: Translates a human-readable domain name into its corresponding blockchain address.
- **deployContract**: Deploys a specified Solidity smart contract to a blockchain network.

  These tools make the Creator Agent ideal for resolving blockchain identifiers and managing contract deployments on various networks.
</Callout>

## Defining Your Needs

To get the best results, determine what you want the Creator Agent to do based on its capabilities. Here are some scenarios to consider:

- If you want to **deploy a new smart contract**, prepare the contract’s details and specify the blockchain network.
- If you need to **resolve a domain name** into a blockchain address, provide the domain name.
- If you need to **resolve a blockchain address** to check for an associated domain, provide the blockchain address.

## Interacting with the Creator Agent

To ensure smooth interaction with the Creator Agent, follow these guidelines:

- **Provide Clear Instructions**: When requesting a contract deployment, clearly specify the contract details, network, and any required parameters.
- **Domain and Address Resolution**: If you’re resolving domains or addresses, provide precise and accurate details.

## How to Use the Creator Agent

Follow these steps to use the Creator Agent effectively:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Define the Task

Determine what you want to achieve—whether it’s deploying a smart contract, resolving a domain name, or resolving an address. Having a clear task in mind will help the Creator Agent deliver more accurate results.

### Step 2: Input Your Request

Enter your request in a way that aligns with the Creator Agent’s capabilities. Be specific about details like contract parameters, addresses, and domain names.

### Step 3: Review the Result

The Creator Agent will process the request and deliver the output. For contract deployment, verify the network and deployment details. For domain or address resolutions, check that the resolved information is correct.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Ensure all contract and domain details are correct before deploying or resolving to avoid any unintended actions or errors.
</Callout>

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Deploying a Smart Contract

1. **Define the Contract**: Specify the contract details, including its functions, network, and any dependencies.
2. **Request Deployment**: Ask the Creator Agent to deploy the contract to your specified blockchain network.
3. **Verify Deployment**: Once deployed, the Creator Agent will return the contract address and a link to the blockchain explorer.

### Resolving a Domain Name

- **Request Domain Resolution**: Provide the domain name you want to translate.
- **Receive the Address**: The Creator Agent returns the associated blockchain address if available.

### Resolving an Address

- **Request Address Resolution**: Input the blockchain address you want to resolve.
- **Receive Domain**: The Creator Agent returns the associated human-readable domain if a record exists.
